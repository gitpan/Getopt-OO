Getopt-OO version 0.04
======================
$Id: README,v 1.3 2005/01/23 20:41:23 sjs Exp $

Getopt::OO - Perl object oriented version of command line parser 
that uses a perl hash as template to describe command line 
options.  The module also alows the developer to associate basic 
help messages with the options so that the basic usage message 
and the definition of the command line parsing are tied together.
The parser handles most common command line parsing. 

The goal of this parser is to provide enough functionality that 
all the command line parsing can be done by the parser.  When the
parser has completed its task, the various options and values 
from the command line are easily accessable to the programmer, 
and he knows the command line arguments were valid.
