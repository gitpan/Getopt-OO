Revision history for Perl extension Getopt::OO.

0.01  Wed Dec 29 14:07:26 2004
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
        -XA -n Getopt::OO
0.02  Sun Jan 16, 2005
    - Cleaned up documentation.
    - Added test cases and fixed one bad test case.
    - Fixed problems in required and mutual_exclusive options.
    - Modified mutual_exclusive so it will accept either a 
      list of lists or a list as necessary.
    - Tested with Cygwin under Windows with PERL 5.8 and 
      under SuSE linux with PERL 5.8.5 and 5.5.4.
    - Got rid of 'our' keyword so we would work with perl 5.5.
    - Modified the test case to not use Test::More which isn't
      available on the older releases.
0.03  Monday Jan 17, 2005
    - Added additional error checking so we would catch 
      invalid multi-character short options.
    - Added an other_args option to fill out the usage statement.
    - Modified usage message so we print the required options.
    - Updated the README and Changes files which were missed
      in 0.02.
    - Made changes so we should work under PERL 5.004 but this
      has not yet been tested.
0.04 Sunday 1/23/2004
    - Renamed the other_args to be other_values to make things
      more consistent.
    - other_values no takes a number instead of a string and can
      be used to help the parser know how many arguments are expected
      after all the options have been parsed.
    - Changes so we would work under 5.4 perl.
    - Changes to docs to cleanup and reflect changes to code.
    - Added multi-valued option.  Syntax is --arg ... - where
      the final '-' can be either the start of the next argument
      or a free-standing dash.
    - Fixed a problem with calculation of the indent for the
      help strings.
    - Added code to better check the non-dashed tags for validity.
    - Fixed a problem that was causing options to be dropped from
      the first line of the usage output.
    - Added more test cases for new options and to better check
      old ones.
    - Print line numbers for test when test is run as
      perl -Ilib t/Getopt-OO.t

    - Fixed a problem with indent.
    - Fixed a problem with Getopt and mulit-value.
    - Added ability of other_values to use callback and ClientData.
    - Added several tests.
    - Modified error message for callback so that name of option 
      generating error is displayed.
    - This should be it for feature modifications.
