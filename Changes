    - Cleaned up documentation.
    - Added test cases and fixed one bad test case.
    - Fixed problems in required and mutual_exclusive options.
    - Modified mutual_exclusive so it will accept either a 
      list of lists or a list as necessary.
    - Tested with Cygwin under Windows with PERL 5.8 and 
      under SuSE linux with PERL 5.8.5 and 5.5.4.
    - Got rid of 'our' keyword so we would work with perl 5.5.
    - Modified the test case to not use Test::More which isn't
      available on the older releases.
0.03  Monday Jan 17, 2005
    - Added additional error checking so we would catch 
      invalid multi-character short options.
    - Added an other_args option to fill out the usage statement.
    - Modified usage message so we print the required options.
    - Updated the README and Changes files which were missed
      in 0.02.
    - Made changes so we should work under PERL 5.004 but this
      has not yet been tested.
